# Installation Challenge -

I have successfully installed and run the JDE Excercies in my Ubuntu OS along with ROS and Gazebo simulator.
The screenshots are of the execution of a Amazon_Warehouse Exercise.

I have also uploaded my terminal dump in the text file.

Result - I have uploaded a video of the excercise executing from the logic of the MyAlgorithm.py file.
